##In the context of design patterns, decorators dynamically alter the functionality of a function, method or class without having to directly use subclasses. 
##This is ideal when you need to extend the functionality of functions that you don't want to modify.

	def my_decorator(func):

		def this_fn_runs():
			print "I am now going to execute the function that calls this decorator"
			func()
			print "I am now going to execute my own stuff"
			print "from teh decorator"
